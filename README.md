# curriculum-vitae
LaTeX source for my personal version of the CV.

## Purpose
I want to write my CV in LaTeX to create something personal, original and good-looking. Moreover, I use this as an excuse to learn to write a LaTeX document class. Probably I will succeed mostly in the last thing.

## References
I take inspiration mainly from the document class [moderncv](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) because it is the most professional and clean I have found, even though there some changes I would like to introduce.
