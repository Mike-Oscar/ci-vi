# ci-vi
LaTeX source code for my personal design of the curriculum vitae.

## Purpose
I want to write my CV in LaTeX to create something personal, original and good-looking. Moreover, I use this as an excuse to learn to write a LaTeX document class. Probably I will succeed mostly in the last thing.

## References
I take inspiration mainly from the document class [moderncv](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) because it is the most professional and clean I have found, even though I would like to introduce some changes. Obviously, I may have been inspired by many other CV styles and examples I have seen over time, but in this case my intentions are far from copy the creation of others.

## Fun facts
I had no idea how to make a good title for this repo (or at least, one following my twisted sense of humor), so I decided to use the writing of the acronym pronounced in Italian. Very simple, very trivial, anyway this makes a serious thing like this a cute one.
